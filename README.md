# python_blender_serial


The easy solution is to just download this version of blender. It has PIP installed as well as pySerial.  

Using Blender to control a Arduino micro controller via serial communication.

The .ino can be installed on to your Arduino compatible mico-controller.

Verify that your baud rate / serial port is the same as the .blend file.

- Open Blender
- In the Blender console 
    
    - import pip
    - pip.main(['install', 'WHATEVER PACKAGE U NEEDl'])

*This is really handy if you have other packages to install 


If you want to download from blender site and configure yourself. Take a look at these links:
